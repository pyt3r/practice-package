Welcome to the practice-package!
================================

The practice-package is ongoing project intended to explore topics
and problems in software development, quantitative finance, machine
learning, and probability.

The package also serves as a boiler plate for configuring automated
testing (via `Azure Pipelines`_), as well as automated documentation (via
`Read the Docs`_).

The source code for the project is located under:
https://github.com/pyt3r/practice-package.
