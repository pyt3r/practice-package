`Fifty Challenging Problems in Probability with Solutions`
by Frederick Mosteller


Problem:
  A drawer contains red socks and black socks.
  When two socks are drawn at random, the
  probability that both are red is 1/2.

    (a) How small can the number of socks in the drawer be?

    (b) How small if the number of black socks is even?

Solution:
  This is a test for mathematical notation.

  .. math::

     (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2

     (a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2
